# EPIC 3 - Brainstorm

This section keeps the expedition mission theme. The backgound will use the mountain topography [topography.png] and have briefing boxes.

## Initial State

- **Background:** 2 Layers. A mountain topography [topography.png] on top of a night sky colored layer.
- **Selection Options:** 3 options to select from: Career and Skills, and Home (returns to landing page). These options should be buttons on the top left corner of the screen. The selected option should be highlighted. The buttons should have no outline and no border and no background color (transparent). The buttons should have a typing effect on entrance and should have a glitch effect. Fonts: Oxanium, with a larger size.
- **Contact Section:** Copy the contact section from the landing page, but with different colors and fonts (alpine mist for the background, night summit for the text, and slate rock for the icons).

## Career Selected State

- **Main Box Opening:** A box opens from the top left corner of the screen, with a scale up animation ocupying a big chunk of the top half of the screen. The box should have a typing effect on entrance. Fonts: Oxanium, with a larger size.
- **Main Box Image:** Inside the box, there should be an image of a side topography of a mountain, with dots at each level of the mountain, representing the career milestones there should be a base camp representation at the bottom of the mountain, representing the education. The dots should have a label next to them, representing the job. The dots should have a typing effect on entrance. Fonts: Oxanium.
- **Career Box Opening:** When the user clicks on a career milestone, a box opens on the bottom half of the screen, with a margin from the main box. The Box should open with a scale up animation from its top left corner to the bottom right corner and should have a typing effect on entrance. A text should be displayed with the description of the career milestone.
- **Selecting a different job milestone:** Selecting a different job milestone should close the career box and open the new one.
- **Selecting Skills:** Selecting Skills should close both boxes with a reverse animation and open the skills box.
- **Selecting Home:** Selecting Home should close both boxes with a reverse animation and return to the landing page.

## Skills Selected State

- **Main Box Opening:** A box opens from the top left corner of the screen, with a scale up animation ocupying a big chunk of the left quarter of the screen, witch will act as a sidebar with different types of skills. The box should have a typing effect on entrance. Fonts: Oxanium, with a larger size.
- **Skills Box Opening:** When the user clicks on a skill type, a box opens on the right side of the main box, with a scale up animation from its top left corner to the bottom right corner and should have a typing effect on entrance. Then all the skills from the skill type with their respective load bars should be displayed in the box. One skill skill should be loaded at a tipe and there should be a load bar animation. The load bar should be rugged and squared, inspired by a terminal loading bar.
- **Selecting a different skill type:** Selecting a different skill type should close the skills box and open the new one.
- **Selection Career:** Selecting Career should close both boxes with a reverse animation and open the career box.
- **Selecting Home:** Selecting Home should close both boxes with a reverse animation and return to the landing page.

## Side MountainTopography

- The side topography should be constructed using code (svg?). It should simulate a 2D sideview topography of a mountain. It should have as many levels as the career milestones. It should have a transparent background and the same outline as the box. It should have a drawing animation on entrance. It should be have sharp angles (it can be kind of geometrical, but should resemble a mountain topography).
