# Feature Plan: F-3.3 - Skills Terminal Accordion

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Skills Terminal in the Career section. It utilizes a technical dashboard aesthetic with rugged progress bars and accordion-style expansions for detailed technical specifications.

---

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Categorized Clusters**: Group professional competencies into 4 distinct clusters (Finance, Data, Full Stack, Leadership/AI).
- **Rugged Progress Bars**: Visual proficiency indicators using a blocky, terminal-style SVG/CSS bar (#82b7f5).
- **Accordion Interaction**: Clicking a skill entry expands to reveal technical sub-details and specific technology stacks, replacing the previous tooltip concept.
- **Aesthetic Consistency**: Matches the high-contrast `Alpine Mist` and `Night Summit` theme with `Oxanium` typography for data.

## 🎬 Animation & Interaction Strategy

1. **Terminal Opening**: Identical to `CareerBox`, scaling from top-left with a "Loading..." sequence.
2. **Progress Bar Boot-up**: On category expansion, the progress bars animate from 0% to their target level with a staggered delay for each skill.
3. **Double Accordion Logic**:
   - **Level 1**: Expand/Collapse the 4 main clusters.
   - **Level 2**: Expand/Collapse specific technical logs for each skill.
4. **Visual Feedback**: Active sections gain a subtle `glacier-steel` border-left or glow to guide the eye.

## 🛠️ Implementation Tasks

1. **Create `SkillsBox.tsx`**: The main container component similar to `CareerBox`.
2. **Develop `RuggedProgressBar`**: A custom component that creates a "notched" or "blocky" fill effect.
3. **Internal Accordion State**: Manage which category AND which skill is currently expanded.
4. **Update `ExpeditionHub.tsx`**: Integrate the `SkillsBox` into the layout and navigation terminal.
5. **Mobile Responsive Check**: Ensure the nested accordions don't become too cramped on smaller screens by potentially flattening the hierarchy.
