# Feature Plan: F-3.2 - Career Accordion Logs

This feature implements an accordion-style expansion for career milestones within the `CareerBox`. Clicking a milestone will reveal its detailed professional logs, skills, and links directly below the entry header.

---

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Accordion Interaction:** Smooth vertical expansion using `framer-motion` for height and opacity.
- **Initial Loading Sequence:** When the `CareerBox` first opens, implement a terminal-style loading animation ("Loading", "Loading.", "Loading..", "Loading...") before revealing the milestones.
- **Data Completeness:** Includes the full 9-point career history from Citibank to Z-Score.
- **Technical Aesthetics:** No mission/climbing analogies in the text; use technical headers like `EXPERIENCE_LOG` and `SKILLS_DEVELOPED`.
- **UX Flow:** Clicking a new milestone expands its section while optionally collapsing others to maintain focus.

## 🎬 Animation Strategy

### 1. Initial Loading Sequence
- **Logic:** Trigger when `isOpen` becomes true.
- **Steps:** "Loading" -> "Loading." -> "Loading.." -> "Loading..." (approx. 200ms per step).
- **Visual:** Monospace font, `glacier-steel` color, subtle fade-in of the first text.

### 2. Accordion Slide
- **Container:** `framer-motion`'s `motion.div` around the detail section.
- **Transition:** `initial={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}` to `animate={{ height: "auto", opacity: 1 }}`.
- **Exit:** `exit={{ height: 0, opacity: 0 }}`.
- **Ease:** `easeInOut` for a natural mechanical feel.

### 3. Header Interaction
- **Indicator:** A technical `[ + ]` or `[ - ]` indicator next to the role that rotates or switches states.
- **Active State:** The parent entry gets a subtle border highlight or background shift to reinforce the "active" context.

## 🛠️ Implementation Tasks

1. **Update `lib/data/expedition.ts`**: Replace current placeholders with this comprehensive 9-entry dataset.
2. **Implement `LoadingSequence` component**: A small utility to handle the `Loading...` animation inside `CareerBox`.
3. **Refactor `CareerBox.tsx`**: Add state to track if loading is complete before rendering `CareerEntry` list.
4. **Refactor `CareerEntry.tsx`**: Add internal `isOpen` state and the expanded section.
5. **Smooth Scrolling**: Ensure that when an entry expands, it remains in view if it exceeds the viewport height.
