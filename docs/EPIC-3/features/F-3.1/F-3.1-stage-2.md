# Feature Plan: F-3.1 Stage 2 - Log Entry Architecture

This stage implements the core content structure of the Career Log, focusing on the milestone level lines, vertical scrolling, and the "Information Pinning" behavior (Sticky Labels).

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Log Entries:** Zero-description minimal log. Focused on identity and chronology.
- **Fixed Geometry:** The `CareerBox` dimensions are absolute. Content MUST be contained within its current layout; all overflow is handled by internal **vertical and horizontal** scrolling.
- **Bi-Directional Scrolling:** 
    - **Vertical:** Standard list progression with the "Scissoring" effect for milestones.
    - **Horizontal:** Allows for ultra-wide text or future data columns without expanding the physical box. Sticky labels (Company/Period) remain pinned to the viewport edges during lateral movement.
- **The "High-Horizon" Line:** A solid horizontal separator (`border-glacier-steel/20`) that divides identity labels.
- **Internal Padding:** Entries maintain a strict margin from the box borders. Lines and text MUST NOT touch the edges of the `CareerBox`.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic:** 
    - No boxes or borders around text elements. 
    - Backgrounds are transparent.
    - Only text and the horizontal "Horizon Line" are visible.
- **Layout Construction:**
    - **Header Row (Sticky Horizontal):** 
        - **Left:** Company Name (`sticky left-0`).
        - **Right:** Period/Year range (`sticky right-0`).
    - **Separator Row:** The full-width Horizon Line (constrained by padding).
    - **Sub-Header Row:** Position Title below the line (anchored left).
- **Vertical "Scissoring":** Each professional milestone is configured as a `sticky top-0` block. As you scroll, the current entry remains "pinned" at the top of the `CareerBox` until the next milestone pushes it out of the viewport.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Component Roles

### 1. Data Schema (`lib/data/expedition.ts`)
Update `CAREER_DATA` to be a flat array of identity objects:
- `company`: string
- `role`: string
- `period`: string

### 2. The Entry Component (`CareerEntry.tsx`)
A minimal row-based component:
- **Container**: `w-full py-8 flex flex-col`.
- **Top Row**: `flex justify-between items-end pb-1 font-oxanium text-sm text-white tracking-widest`.
- **Separator**: `h-[1px] w-full bg-glacier-steel/30`.
- **Bottom Row**: `pt-1 font-mono text-[10px] text-glacier-steel/60`.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Update Data (`lib/data/expedition.ts`)
Populate with CV data (Z-Score, I.Systems, Queluz, Óticas Carol, Banco Fator, Brasil Plural).

### 2. New Component (`CareerEntry.tsx`)
Create the split-line component. Ensure the "Period" on the right is pinned and doesn't shift.

### 3. Integration (`CareerBox.tsx`)
Remove standard padding to allow the level lines to touch the container edges if desired, or maintain a strict technical margin.

## 📂 New Files to Create
- `app/src/components/blocks/expedition/CareerEntry.tsx`

---

## 🧪 Verification Plan
- **Sticky Check**: Verify that `COMPANY_A` stays at the top of the box until `COMPANY_B` pushes it out.
- **Alignment Check**: Confirm Company is left-aligned and Years are right-aligned.
- **Scroll Check**: Ensure the box doesn't overflow the footer margins during scrolling.
