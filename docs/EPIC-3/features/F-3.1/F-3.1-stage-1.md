# Feature Plan: F-3.1 Stage 1 - Career Box Foundation

This stage implements the structural container for the Career Log, focusing on the layout boundaries, identity branding, and the "Top-Left Scale" entrance animation.

---

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Container:** A semi-transparent "Alpine Mist" briefing box.
- **Placement:** Positioned to the right of the `NavigationTerminal`, filling the available space while maintaining a strict lower margin above the footer.
- **Animation:** The box scales from `0` to `1` using `transform-origin: top left` when the "CAREER" tab is selected.
- **Branding:** Header displays `[ CAREER_LOG ]` and technical system metadata.

## 🏛️ Architecture & Component Roles

To implement the "Expedition Mission" interface, we follow a strictly orchestrated component hierarchy within the `ExpeditionHub`:

### 1. The Orchestrator (`ExpeditionHub.tsx`)
The root component for the `/career` route. It acts as the "Mission Commander," managing the global `activeTab` state.
- **State Management:** Tracks `activeTab` ('career' | 'skills' | null).
- **Layout Control:** Orchestrates the visibility and z-index of technical overlays and content boxes.

### 2. The Command Terminal (`NavigationTerminal.tsx`)
A side-aligned interactive menu that communicates user intent back to the Orchestrator.
- **Communication:** Receives an `onTabChange` callback to update the global state.
- **Visuals:** Handles the sequential character-by-character typing entrance for its menu items.

### 3. The Mission Box (`CareerBox.tsx`)
A technical responsive container for the professional log.
- **Animation:** Utilizes `framer-motion`'s `AnimatePresence` for seamless entrance and exit transitions.
- **Technical Styling:** Implemented with `bg-alpine-mist/5` and `backdrop-blur-sm`, constrained to stay within the "Safe Area" above the footer.
- **Responsiveness:** Automatically adjusts its `transform-origin` (top-left for desktop, top for mobile) using the `useMediaQuery` hook.

### 4. Shared Infrastructure
- **`lib/data/expedition.ts`:** Centralized source for navigation configuration and animation timing constants.
- **`hooks/use-media-query.ts`:** Provides real-time viewport feedback to ensure the box expansion feels native to both desktop and mobile layouts.

---


### 1. State Management (`ExpeditionHub.tsx`)
- Add `activeTab` state to track if `career`, `skills`, or `null` is selected.
- Pass `onTabChange` handler to the `NavigationTerminal`.

### 2. The Box Component (`CareerBox.tsx`)
- Create a reusable `AnimatePresence` wrapper.
- Styles: `bg-alpine-mist/5`, `backdrop-blur-sm`, `border-glacier-steel/20`.
- Constraints: Ensure the box doesn't push the footer off-screen (e.g., `max-h-[70vh]`).

### 3. Transition Logic
- **Initial:** `scale: 0`, `opacity: 0`.
- **Animate:** `scale: 1`, `opacity: 1` with `easeOut` (0.4s).
- **Origin:** `transform-origin: top left`.

---

## 📱 Mobile Considerations

The box will occupy full width below the top-aligned navigation icons, scaling from `top` instead of `top-left`.

## 📂 New Files to Create
- `app/src/components/blocks/expedition/CareerBox.tsx`
- `app/src/hooks/use-media-query.ts` (Required for responsive checks)
