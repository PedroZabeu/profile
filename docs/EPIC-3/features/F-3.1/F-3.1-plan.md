# Feature Plan: F-3.1 High-Horizon Identity Log

This feature implements the core professional history interface: a high-contrast, bi-directional scrolling terminal log featuring "Scissoring" sticky milestones.

---

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Metaphor:** The professional log is a continuous technical stream of milestones.
- **Style:** Zero-description minimal log. Focused on identity and chronology.
- **Aesthetic:** High-contrast "Glacier Steel" lines and "White" identity text against a semi-transparent "Alpine Mist/5" box.
- **Interactivity:** Bi-directional scrolling (Internal Vertical & Horizontal) with horizontal information pinning.

---

## 🗺️ Layout & Components

### 1. Navigation Terminal (Left Side)
- Vertical menu (`CAREER`, `SKILLS`, `HOME`).
- `CAREER` active state triggers the display of the log.

### 2. High-Horizon Log Container (`CareerBox.tsx`)
- **Fixed Geometry:** Occupies the right-hand viewport space with strict internal padding.
- **Header:** `[ CAREER_LOG ]` with technical scroll chevrons `[ ^ ]` and `[ v ]`.
- **Bi-Directional Viewport:** Supports vertical scrolling for the timeline and potential horizontal overflow for wide content.

### 3. Sticky Milestone Entries (`CareerEntry.tsx`)
- **Vertical Scissoring:** Each entry sticks to the top of the box until the next one pushes it out.
- **Horizontal Pinning:**
    - **Company Name:** Pinned to the left top-edge.
    - **Period/Years:** Pinned to the right top-edge.
    - **Role Title:** Pinned to the left bottom-edge (below the line).
- **The Horizon Line:** A solid horizontal separator dividing the entry data.

## 🎬 Interaction Logic

### 1. Entrance Animation
- **Top-Left Scale**: The box expands from the navigation origin point with a 0.4s ease-out transition.

### 2. Scrolling & Navigation
- **Custom Scrollbar**: Ultra-thin (`2px`) glacier-steel thumb with smooth track.
- **Scroll Buttons**: Functional `[ ^ ]` and `[ v ]` icons for instant smooth scrolling to poles.

### 3. Milestone CTA (Stage 3 Integration)
- **Hover Access**: Hovering an entry reveals the `[ ACCESS_LOG ]` tag.
- **Row Highlighting**: Subtle opacity boost and background illumination (glacier-steel/5) on active rows.
- **Pointer Cue**: The entire entry acts as an interactive button to access deep experience logs.

## 📂 Implementation: File Structure

- `app/src/components/blocks/expedition/`
  - `CareerBox.tsx`: The main scaling container and scroll orchestrator.
  - `CareerEntry.tsx`: Individual milestone component with scissoring and pinning logic.
- `app/src/lib/data/expedition.ts`: Central data source for `CAREER_DATA`.

---

## 🧪 Verification Plan
- **Geometry Lock**: Verify the `CareerBox` maintains its fixed size across all content lengths.
- **Sticky Alignment**: Confirm level lines and labels do not touch the box borders due to internal padding.
- **Scissoring Logic**: Ensure the "pushing" behavior of sticky headers works smoothly during vertical scroll.
- **CTA Visibility**: Verify the `[ ACCESS_LOG ]` tag appears/disappears correctly via `AnimatePresence`.
