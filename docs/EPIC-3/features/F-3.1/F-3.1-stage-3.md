# Feature Plan: F-3.1 Stage 3 - Interactive Milestone CTA

This stage transforms the static career log into an interactive dashboard where each milestone acts as a Call-to-Action (CTA) to access deep experience logs.

---

## 🏗️ Visual & Technical Objective

- **Milestone Interaction:** Each `CareerEntry` becomes a fully interactive zone.
- **Hover Elegance:** A "System Access" aesthetic. Hovering on an entry should feel like highlighting a row in a technical terminal.
- **Visual Cues:**
    - **Row Highlight:** A very subtle `bg-white/5` or `bg-glacier-steel/5` background fade.
    - **Cursor:** `cursor-pointer`.
    - **Interaction Pointer:** A minimalist "EXPAND" icon or a technical chevron that slides into view upon hover.
- **Action:** Clicking an entry triggers the `ExpeditionLog` modal/view (to be detailed in Stage 3 implementation).

## 🏛️ Architecture & Component Roles

### 1. Updated `CareerEntry.tsx`
- Wrap the entry in a `button` or `div` with `onClick`.
- Add `framer-motion` `whileHover` states for the background transition.
- Implement the "View Log" tag that appears on the right edge.

### 2. State Orchestration (`ExpeditionHub.tsx`)
- Define a `selectedMilestone` state.
- Handle the logic for opening the detailed Modal/Overlay.

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Refine `CareerEntry.tsx` Interaction
- Add `group` class for hover-based animations of inner elements.
- Clean up the layout to ensure the entire row is the hit area.

### 2. The "Access Tag" Animation
- Animate a small label `[ VIEW_DETAILS ]` or `[ ACCESS_LOG ]` that slides from right to left (alpha 0 -> 1) when the row is hovered.

### 3. Detail View Preparation
- Placeholder logic for opening the details (Stage 4 will focus on the actual content of the details).

---

## 📂 New Files to Create
- None (refining existing components).

---

## 🧪 Verification Plan
- **Hover Feedback**: Verify that the entire row highlights and the CTA tag appears smoothly.
- **Pointer Consistency**: Ensure the cursor changes to a pointer across the entire level line zone.
- **Click Trigger**: Verify a console log or placeholder alert fires upon clicking.
