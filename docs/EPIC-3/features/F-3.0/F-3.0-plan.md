# Feature Plan: F-3.0 Expedition Hub (Initial State)

This feature establishes the entry point and atmospheric foundation for the Career & Skills section. It follows the **Expedition Mission Briefing** theme, creating a sense of professional readiness and high-altitude precision.

---

## 🏔️ Visual & Atmospheric Objective

The "Initial State" is a high-tech, immersive dashboard in "standby" mode. When the user lands here, the system should feel like it is booting up a mission interface.

- **Theme:** High-End Terminal / Mission Command.
- **Colors:** Deep Night Sky foundation with "Alpine Mist" and "Glacier Steel" technical overlays.
- **Typography:** **Oxanium** for the technical command buttons; **Geist Sans** for metadata.

---

## 🗺️ Layout & Components

The interface is composed of three primary layers:

### 1. Navigation Terminal (Top-Left)
The primary interaction point. It contains three options: `CAREER`, `SKILLS`, and `HOME`.
- **Style:** No borders, no background, fully transparent.
- **Entrance:** Buttons appear one by one using a character-by-character typing effect.
- **Interaction:** A subtle CRT glitch effect triggers when the user hovers over an option.

### 2. Immersive Atmospheric Background
A dual-layer visual system.
- **Base Layer:** A solid "Night Summit" (deep dark blue) color.
- **Overlay Layer:** The `topography.png` image. It should have a low opacity and a scanning flicker effect.
- **Dynamic Element:** A subtle vertical "scanning line" that travels across the screen every few seconds.

### 3. Expedition Contact Footer
A simplified version of the main landing page's contact section, adjusted for the "dark altitude" theme.
- **Color Swap:** Alpine Mist for the container, Night Summit for the text labels.
- **Micro-Interaction:** Icons with revealable detail boxes (tooltips) on hover/click, just like the main page.
- **Alignment:** Right-aligned layout for the interactive group.

## 📂 Implementation: File Structure

To maintain the modular **Expedition Mission** architecture, we will organize the files as follows:

### 1. New Route
- `app/src/app/career/page.tsx`: The entry point for the Career/Skills experience. It will host the main state (Current Mission) and render the Hub or the specific selected box.

### 2. Components (`src/components/`)
- `blocks/expedition/`
  - `NavigationTerminal.tsx`: Handles the typing/glitch command buttons.
  - `TopographyBackground.tsx`: Coordinates the `topography.png` overlay and the "Night Summit" base.
  - `ScanLine.tsx`: A micro-component for the horizontal/vertical scanning light effect.
  - `ExpeditionFooter.tsx`: The simplified contact briefing in dark mode.
- `sections/expedition/`
  - `ExpeditionHub.tsx`: The container component that manages the "Initial State" atmosphere and transitions.

### 3. Styles & Types (`src/lib/`)
- `lib/data/expedition.ts`: Shared constants for navigation labels and animation timings.

---

## ⚡ Animation & Interaction Specifications

### Entrance Logic
1.  **System Boot:** The `topography.png` layer fades in while flickering (opacity jumps between 5% and 15% rapidly for 0.5s).
2.  **Command Reveal:**
    - Button 1 (`CAREER`) types out in 0.3s.
    - Button 2 (`SKILLS`) types out in 0.3s (after a short delay).
    - Button 3 (`HOME`) types out in 0.3s.

### Idle Behavior (The "Standby" Pulse)
- A faint light bar (1px height, translucent Glacier Steel) moves from top to bottom every 8 seconds.
- The text "SYSTEM: STANDBY" or a mission timestamp might pulse very subtly in the bottom right.

## 📱 Mobile Adaptation

On mobile devices, the typography background becomes more static to save performance, and the buttons are centered or listed vertically with larger touch targets.
