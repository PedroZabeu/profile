# F2.5 - Scroll Button Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Implement the final interactive element of the `/animated-showcase` route - a scroll button that serves as the call-to-action after all dots have completed their entrance sequence. This button should have enhanced visibility and a distinctive glitchy entrance with bounce effect.

## 🧱 Key Components

### 1. `AnimatedScrollButton`
- **Purpose**: A prominent scroll indicator that appears after all interactive elements are ready.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/scroll-button/AnimatedScrollButton.tsx`
- **Features**:
    - **Enhanced Visibility**: Whiter color scheme for better contrast against the landscape
    - **Glitchy Entrance**: Quick glitch effect followed by a subtle bounce
    - **Simplified Message**: Displays "CONTACT" instead of "SCROLL"
    - **Scroll Functionality**: Smooth scroll all the way to the contact section
    - **Positioning**: Bottom center of viewport, above contact section

### 2. `ScrollButtonContainer`
- **Purpose**: Manages the timing and layering of the scroll button within the animation sequence.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/scroll-button/ScrollButtonContainer.tsx`
- **Orchestration**:
    - **Start Trigger**: 2.3s after page load (immediately after dots complete)
    - **Animation Duration**: Total 0.8s for complete entrance sequence (2.3s - 3.1s)
    - **Interaction State**: Continuous subtle pulse/bounce to draw attention

### Final Layout State
```text
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                           |
|                     [  LOGO (F2.3)  ]                     |
|                                                           |
|   (Career)                    (Projects)                 (Adventures)
|    [ DOT 1 ]                     [ DOT 2 ]                  [ DOT 3 ]
|                                                           |
|                                                           |
|                     [  CONTACT ]                          |
|                    ( F2.5 - Current )                      |
|                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Entrance Sequence Timing
```text
T=2.3s: All dots settled
T=2.3s: [ CONTACT ] Starts entrance
        - Total animation duration: 0.8s
        - Glitch effect + bounce + fade in
T=3.1s: Button fully visible and interactive
```

### Visual Design Specifications
```text
+-----------------+
|    CONTACT      |
| (Oxanium font)  |
| (No background) |
+-----------------+

Enhanced contrast:
- Text: Pure white (#FFFFFF) with subtle glow
- Font: Oxanium (tracking-widest)
- Background: None (transparent)
```

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### 1. Component Creation
- Create directory: `components/animated-showcase/scroll-button/`
- Create `AnimatedScrollButton.tsx` with:
    - Simplified "CONTACT" text
    - Oxanium font (semibold)
    - Pure text glitch animation (no bounce/pulse)
    - No background or border
    - Scroll functionality (same as showcase)

### 2. Animation Implementation
```javascript
const glitchBounceEntrance = {
  initial: { opacity: 0, scale: 0.8, y: 20 },
  animate: { 
    opacity: 1, 
    scale: 1, 
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      delay: 2.3, // Start after dots complete at 2.3s
      duration: 0.8,
      ease: [0.68, -0.55, 0.265, 1.55] // bounce easing
    }
  }
};

const glitchKeyframes = {
  scale: [1, 1.1, 0.9, 1.05, 1],
  opacity: [0, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 1],
  filter: ["blur(2px)", "blur(0px)", "blur(1px)", "blur(0px)"],
  transition: { duration: 0.8 }
};
```

### 3. Styling Enhancements
- Use `font-oxanium` and `tracking-[0.3em]`
- Remove all backgrounds, borders, and backdrops
- Implement continuous subtle jitter glitch
- Add occasional color-shift text glitch overlays

### 4. Integration
- Update `app/animated-showcase/page.tsx`
- Add scroll button to the sticky container at `z-25`
- Ensure proper layering: below dots (`z-20`) but above content
- Implement same smooth scroll behavior as `/showcase`

### 5. Parallax Consistency
- Apply same mouse parallax effect as other elements
- Use `useTransform(scrollY, [0, 500], [0, -30])` for vertical movement
- Maintain consistent movement with page scroll

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Scroll button appears at T=2.2s (after all dots complete entrance)
- [ ] Entrance and continuous state uses glitch effect (no bounce/pulse)
- [ ] Text displays "CONTACT" in Oxanium font
- [ ] Clicking triggers smooth scroll to contact section
- [ ] Button includes subtle continuous jitter glitch for attention
- [ ] Parallax effects match other elements on mouse movement
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during final animation sequence
- [ ] Original `/showcase` functionality remains unchanged
- [ ] Complete animation sequence (0s - 3.1s) flows naturally with 0.8s scroll button entrance

## 🎯 Final Result

After F2.5 completion, the `/animated-showcase` route will provide a complete, progressively animated experience:
1. **0.0s-0.3s**: Background and clouds visible
2. **0.3s-0.8s**: Logo entrance with fade + slide
3. **0.8s-2.3s**: Sequential dots with glitch entrance
4. **2.3s-3.1s**: Contact button with glitch + bounce (0.8s duration)
5. **3.1s+**: Fully interactive page ready for exploration

This creates a professional, engaging entrance sequence that guides users through the feature discovery process while maintaining the same core functionality as the original `/showcase`.
