# F2.1 - Image and Design Details Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Establish the structural foundation of the `/animated-showcase` route. This feature focuses on replicating the core layout of existing elements from the `/showcase` page, including the parallax background and the descriptive details. To improve flow, the Design and Expedition Briefing information will be merged into a single, cohesive "Details" section with tighter vertical spacing.

## 🧱 Key Components

### 1. `AnimatedBackground`
- **Purpose**: Displays the "Mountain Base" landscape with parallax effects.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/background/AnimatedBackground.tsx`
- **Features**: 
    - Full-screen sticky container.
    - Parallax Y-axis movement based on scroll.
    - Subtle parallax X-axis movement based on mouse position.
    - **Note**: Interactive dots (CTAs), clouds, and logo are excluded in this stage.

### 2. `ShowcaseDetails`
- **Purpose**: A single merged section containing both the "Logo Design" and "Expedition Briefing" information.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/sections/ShowcaseDetails.tsx`
- **Content**: 
    - **Upper Block**: Logo Design (Heading, text, font/color samples).
    - **Middle Gap**: Reduced vertical spacing.
    - **Lower Block**: Expedition Briefing (Heading, text, font/color/dot samples).
- **Styling**: `min-h-[70vh]`, `bg-[#0D1B2A]`, consistent padding.

### 3. `ContactSection`
- **Purpose**: Final footer-like section with interactive contact icons.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/sections/ContactSection.tsx`
- **Icons**: 
    - **WhatsApp**: Animated message-circle (Green).
    - **Telegram**: Animated send (Blue).
    - **LinkedIn**: Animated linkedin.
    - **GitHub**: Animated github.
    - **Email**: Animated mail.
- **Note**: Icons will be installed via `npx shadcn` using `animateicons.in` sources.

## 📋 Implementation Steps

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Create directories: 
     - `components/animated-showcase/background`
     - `components/animated-showcase/sections`
   - Create the new route file: `app/animated-showcase/page.tsx`

2. **Icon Installation**:
   - Run the following commands to add animated icons:
     - `npx shadcn@latest add "https://animateicons.in/icons/message-circle.json"` (WhatsApp)
     - `npx shadcn@latest add "https://animateicons.in/icons/send.json"` (Telegram)
     - `npx shadcn@latest add "https://animateicons.in/icons/linkedin.json"` (LinkedIn)
     - `npx shadcn@latest add "https://animateicons.in/icons/github.json"` (GitHub)
     - `npx shadcn@latest add "https://animateicons.in/icons/mail.json"` (Email)

3. **Component Adaptation**:
   - Extract logic from `app/showcase/page.tsx` for the background image and mouse/scroll parallax.
   - Implement `AnimatedBackground.tsx` focused only on the image layer.
   - Implement `ShowcaseDetails.tsx` by merging the two existing JSX sections.
   - Implement `ContactSection.tsx` with the newly installed animated icons.

4. **Refinement**:
   - Verify that colors, fonts (Comfortaa, Oxanium), and samples match the original `/showcase` exactly.
   - Apply brand colors to icons: WhatsApp (Green), Telegram (Blue).
   - Ensure the layout flows smoothly from the Hero to Details and finally to Contact.
