# F2.4 - Dots with Modals Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Introduce interactive exploration points (Dots) to the `/animated-showcase` route. These dots will enter sequentially with a high-tech "glitch" effect, revealing their purpose briefly before settling into a subtle glowing state. Clicking them will open the established expedition briefing modals.

## 🧱 Key Components

### 1. `AnimatedDot`
- **Purpose**: An individual interactive point that represents a section of the profile (Career, Projects, Adventures).
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/dots/AnimatedDot.tsx`
- **Features**:
    - **Glitch Entrance**: Uses Framer Motion's `animate` with rapid scale/opacity steps to simulate a digital glitch.
    - **Brief Label Reveal**: Shows the label (e.g., "CAREER") during entrance, then fades it out after 1-2 seconds.
    - **Hover State**: Re-reveals the label and increases glow intensity.
    - **Click Behavior**: Dispatches the open modal action.
    - **Parallax**: Matches the background parallax shift (`mousePosition.x * 0.15`).

### 2. `SequentialDotsContainer`
- **Purpose**: Manages the orchestration of multiple dots appearing one after another.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/dots/SequentialDotsContainer.tsx`
- **Orchestration**:
    - **Start Trigger**: 0.8s after page load (immediately after `AnimatedLogo` completes).
    - **Interval**: Each dot starts its entrance 0.5s after the previous one.
    - **List**:
        1. **Career Dot** (at ~25%, 75%)
        2. **Projects Dot** (at ~50%, 45%)
        3. **Adventures Dot** (at ~75%, 65%)

### Dot Interaction States
```text
1. ENTRANCE (Glitch)        2. SETTLED (Pulse)          3. HOVER (Reveal)
      
     [ CAREER ]                . . .                       CAREER
     / \  (blur)               . ( o ) .                    [  o  ]
   - < o > -                 . . .                       (glow)
     \ /                                                 (Bright)
    (Glitchy)                 (Subtle)
```

### Sequential Entrance Timing
```text
T=0.8s: Logo Finishes
T=0.8s: [ Career Dot ]   Starts Entrance (Glitch + Label)
T=1.3s: [ Projects Dot ] Starts Entrance
T=1.8s: [ Adventures Dot ] Starts Entrance
T=2.3s: All dots settled. Labels hidden.
```

### Glitch Effect Logic (Framer Motion)
```javascript
const glitchEntrance = {
  scale: [0, 1.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1],
  opacity: [0, 1, 0.5, 1, 0.8],
  filter: ["blur(10px)", "blur(0px)", "blur(5px)", "blur(0px)"],
  transition: { duration: 0.5 }
};
```

## 📋 Implementation Steps

1. **Modal Adaptation**:
   - Ensure `CareerModal`, `ProjectsModal`, and `AdventuresModal` can be reused without modification.

2. **Develop `AnimatedDot` Component**:
   - Port the core logic from `CareerCTA.tsx` (pulsing rings, main dot).
   - Add the entrance animation sequence (`glitchEntrance`).
   - Implement the timer for auto-hiding the label after entrance.

3. **Develop `SequentialDotsContainer`**:
   - Use an array with position and metadata for each CTA.
   - Use Framer Motion's `staggerChildren` or manual delays to handle the 0.5s interval.
   - Position the dots absolutely within the viewport to match the original landscape layout.

4. **Integration**:
   - Place `<SequentialDotsContainer />` as a child of the sticky container in `app/animated-showcase/page.tsx`.
   - Ensure it sits at `z-20` (interactive layer).

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dots are hidden until T=0.8s.
- [ ] Dots appear one by one with a 0.5s staggered start.
- [ ] Each dot performs a visible "glitch" entrance.
- [ ] Labels are visible during entrance and stay for 1.5s before fading.
- [ ] Clicking a dot opens the correct modal (identical to `/showcase`).
- [ ] Hovering over a dot re-reveals its label.
- [ ] Performance remains smooth during the multi-element sequence.
