# F2.3 - Logo Entrance Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Introduce the personal brand identity to the `/animated-showcase` route. The logo will appear after a short delay, using a smooth fade-in and slide-down animation to create a "falling into place" effect. This is the first "entrance" animation of the showcase sequence.

## 🧱 Key Components

### 1. `AnimatedLogo`
- **Purpose**: A specialized wrapper for the brand logo that manages its entrance timing and parallax behavior.
- **Location**: `components/animated-showcase/logo/AnimatedLogo.tsx`
- **Features**:
    - Wraps the existing `Logo` component from `@/components/brand/Logo`.
    - Uses Framer Motion for the entrance sequence.
    - **Timing**: 
        - `initial`: `opacity: 0`, `y: -50`
        - `animate`: `opacity: 1`, `y: 0`
        - `transition`: `delay: 0.3`, `duration: 0.5`, `ease: "easeOut"`
    - **Parallax**: After entrance, it should follow the same mouse-tracking logic as the original showcase (`mousePosition.x * -0.4` and `y: logoY`).

## 📋 Implementation Steps

1. **Component Scaffolding**:
   - Create the directory `components/animated-showcase/logo/`.
   - Create `components/animated-showcase/logo/AnimatedLogo.tsx`.

2. **Logo Implementation**:
   - Import `Logo` from `@/components/brand/Logo`.
   - Implement the entrance animation using `motion.div`.
   - Pass `mousePosition` and `logoY` (scroll transform) as props to maintain the parallax effect.
   - Use `filter drop-shadow-[0_20px_50px_rgba(0,0,0,0.8)]` to match the original showcase depth.

3. **Page Integration**:
   - Update `app/animated-showcase/page.tsx`.
   - Calculate `logoY` using `useTransform(scrollY, [0, 500], [0, -40])`.
   - Place `<AnimatedLogo />` within the sticky container.
   - Ensure it is centered (`flex items-start justify-center pt-12`).

4. **Refinement**:
   - Verify the 0.3s delay feels rhythmically correct after the page load.
   - Ensure the logo remains interactive (pointer-events-auto) while its container is `pointer-events-none`.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Logo is invisible for the first 0.3s of page load.
- [ ] Logo fades in and slides down from T=0.3s to T=0.8s.
- [ ] Logo follows mouse movement (parallax) after appearing.
- [ ] Logo maintains vertical parallax shift when scrolling.
- [ ] Transitions are smooth and 60fps.
- [ ] Original `/showcase` remains unaffected.
