# Feature Plan: F-4.4 - Adventure Debriefing Terminal (Modal UI)

## 🏔️ Overview
This feature implements the **Adventure Briefing Terminal**, a high-fidelity modal interface that allows users to explore specific adventures. Unlike previous manual triggers, this modal now opens **automatically** after a successful location lock-on, creating a fluid transition between global exploration and deep-dive discovery.

## 🎯 Core Interaction Mechanics

### Trigger Mechanism (The Auto-Deep Dive)
To create a seamless "satellite-to-ground" experience, the modal follows this automated lifecycle:
1. **Selection**: User clicks an adventure in the sidebar.
2. **Orbital Positioning**: Globe rotates and locks (F-4.3). The system status flashes `[ POSITIONING... ]`.
3. **Intel Delay**: After the globe reaches the location coordinates (`dist < 0.01`), a **0.5s technical delay** is applied.
4. **UX Feedback**: During this delay, the sidebar item or a central reticle flashes `[ DOWNLOADING_LOGS... ]`.
5. **Auto-Manifest**: The Briefing Modal opens automatically.

## 🎨 Visual Design & Theming

### Layout Structure (The Briefing Grid)
- **Header Layer**: Technical ID `[ MODAL: ADVENTURE_DEBRIEFING ]` and a high-contrast close button `[ X ]`.
- **Top Row (Exploration & Intel)**:
    - **Discovery Photo (Left)**: **Requirement: Fixed 1:1 Square Aspect Ratio**. High-tech container with `backdrop-blur-md` and scanline overlays.
    - **Technical Data Grid (Right)**: Vertical list of key specs:
        - `LOC: [Location]`
        - `ACT: [Activity]`
        - `ALT: [Altitude]`
        - `DATE: [Date]`
- **Bottom Row (Field Log)**:
    - **Field Log Terminal**: A dedicated box for the narrative description.
    - **Typing Effect**: Character-by-character "data downlink" reveal (inspired by the career modal's sequential typing).

### Visual Identity & Animations (EPIC 3 Inspiration)
- **Entrance Animation**: Symmetrical central expansion (`scale: 0.9` to `1.0`) with a sudden `opacity: 0` to `1` glitch flicker.
- **Career Page Synergy**: Uses high-damping spring transitions (`stiffness: 300`, `damping: 30`) to match the "Expedition Operating System" feel found in the `/career` route.
- **Exit Animation**: Reverse scale-down to center, returning focus to the Global Exploration Grid.

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

### 1. Auto-Trigger Logic
- Integrate `useEffect` in `AdventuresPage` that monitors the distance to target (calculated in F-4.3).
- When `dist < 0.01`, trigger a 500ms `setTimeout`.
- Show temporary UI feedback `[ DOWNLOADING_LOGS... ]` in the system log footer during this wait.
- Automatically set `isModalOpen(true)` after timeout.

### 2. Animations (EPIC 3 Style)
- Use `AnimatePresence` for the modal.
- `boxVariants`: `initial: { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 }`, `animate: { scale: 1, opacity: 1 }`, `exit: { scale: 0.9, opacity: 0 }`.
- Ease: `easeOut` with `0.4s` duration.

### 3. Visual Assets (PLACEHOLDER PHASE)
- **Requirement: Square 1:1 container**.
- Use the high-tech placeholder container defined in the previous plan.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking a sidebar item triggers globe rotation followed by an **automatic modal reveal** after 0.5s of lock-on.
- [ ] Modal layout uses a **1:1 square aspect ratio** for the photo container.
- [ ] Animations follow the symmetrical scale/opacity expansion from EPIC 3.
- [ ] All 13 adventures show correct metadata and specific narrative logs.
- [ ] Closing the modal allows the user to select another destination, repeating the cycle.

## 🔗 Next Steps
- **F-4.5**: Visual Exploration Polish (Animations, Glitch FX, Scanning overlays).
- **F-4.6**: Asset Integration (Import and display the 13 generated **1:1 square** images).
