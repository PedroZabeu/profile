# Feature Plan: F-4.1 - The Global Recon Grid (Foundations)

## 🏔️ Overview
This feature establishes the primary environment for the **Summit Logs - Global Archive**. After evaluating two background alternatives, **The Heritage Path** was selected for its superior visual continuity with the existing `/career` route. The interactive environment is now live at `/adventures`.

## 🎨 Visual Identity (Aesthetic & Style)
- **Base Atmosphere**: Consistent with the **Expedition Mission Briefing** theme defined in `outdoor-profile-prd.md`.
- **Selected Background: The Heritage Path**: Uses `TopographyBackground` (flickering topo lines) + `ScanLine` overlay. This maintains 1:1 visual continuity with the `/career` route.
- **Color Palette**:
    - **Primary Base**: `bg-night-summit` (`#0D1B2A`).
    - **Globe Highlights**: `text-alpine-blue` (`#82B7F5`) for the neon glow and orbital markers.
    - **Interface Metadata**: `text-glacier-steel` (`#7A8FA3`) for secondary data.
- **Typography**: 
    - **Oxanium**: Tactical labels and technical data.
    - **Primary Header**: `[ ADVENTURES ]` in white bold Oxanium, matching the global brand identity.
- **Shared Expedition Components**: Uses `TopographyBackground`, `ScanLine`, and **`ExpeditionFooter`** (Contact icons) to ensure the interface feels part of the same operating system.
- **The Sequential Boot-up**: 
    - **UI First**: The interface framing, sidebar headers, footer contacts, and technical readouts initiate a sequential "typing" and "glitch" entrance.
    - **Delayed Recon**: The Globe only begins its entry sequence **after** the UI has reached its stable state (approx. 1.2s delay).
    - **Classy Globe Entry**: A smooth `opacity: 0 to 1` combined with a subtle `scale: 0.95 to 1.0` spring animation.

## 🗺️ Layout & Wireframes

### Desktop View (Global Recon Mode)
The interface is divided into a tactical grid:
1. **Header**: Identification `[ ADVENTURES ]` and system status.
2. **Left Sidebar**: Tactical archive data feeder (Data mapping in F-4.2).
3. **Central Area**: The "Holographic Globe" (Delayed entry, Continual Drift).
4. **Footer**: System logs (Left) and **ExpeditionFooter** Contact section (Right).

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy (Natural Language)

### 1. Route Setup & Base Layout
- Consolidated into a single route: `/app/adventures/page.tsx`.
- Finalized layout using `TopographyBackground` + `ScanLine` overlay.
- Implemented a `Main` container with a fixed height (100vh).

### 2. Holographic Globe (COBE) Implementation
- Integrated `cobe` with a custom drift and `Alpine Blue` highlights.
- Configured with a dotted surface pattern for a digital scan feel.

### 3. Orchestrated Animation Sequence
- Sequential entry for UI framing followed by the globe reveal.
- High-damping spring animations for organic feel.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (Foundation Only)
- [x] Navigating to `/adventures` shows a dark terminal-themed page.
- [x] Renders the `TopographyBackground` for visual continuity.
- [x] A rotating 3D globe is visible in the center of the screen.
- [x] The "Scanlines" effect is active and visible over the UI.
- [x] The header displays `[ ADVENTURES ]`.
- [x] The layout includes responsive placeholders and readouts.
- [x] The page fills the viewport and prevents vertical browser scrolling.
